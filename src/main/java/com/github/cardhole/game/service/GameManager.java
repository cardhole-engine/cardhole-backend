     * In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method
     * (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game
     * chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game
     * makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The game’s
     * default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise.
